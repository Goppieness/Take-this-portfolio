  "description": "A large-scale installation exploring the fragmentation of memory in the digital age. This work combines projected video, found objects, and interactive sensors that respond to viewer presence.\n\nCreated during a residency at the Digital Arts Center, the piece reflects on how our personal archives are increasingly stored in cloud servers rather than physical spaces. The installation invites viewers to walk through a space filled with suspended screens displaying fragmented family photographs, while sensors track movement and alter the display in real-time."
