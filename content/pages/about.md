# About

Alexandra Chen is a contemporary visual artist working at the intersection of digital and traditional media. Her practice explores themes of memory, identity, and the evolving relationship between technology and human experience.

## Artist Statement

Through immersive installations, mixed-media works, and digital interventions, I investigate how our perception of reality is shaped by both physical and virtual spaces. My work often incorporates found materials, archival imagery, and interactive elements that invite viewers to reconsider their relationship with the digital landscape.
