  "description": "An interactive mixed-media work that maps personal memories onto architectural spaces. The piece consists of a series of interconnected rooms, each representing a different period in the artist's life.\n\nVisitors navigate through the installation using a custom-built interface that allows them to explore different memory layers. The work incorporates archival photographs, audio recordings, and 3D-printed objects that serve as memory triggers.\n\n*Memory Palace* was first exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles as part of the \"New Media Perspectives\" group show.",
